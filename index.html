    Insert the information in the form and the calculator will determine the equity ratio<br> 
    What is the equity ratio?<br>
    The equity ratio is a financial ratio that indicates the relative proportion of the equity that is used to finance a company's assets.<br>
    How to calculate equity ratio?<br>
    To calculate equity ratio you should use the following formula:<br>
    equity ratio = total equity / total assets<br>
    example: company x's total assets are $94,000 and the total shareholder equity of the company is $37,000, calculate the equity ratio.<br>
    using the equity ratio the answer will be:<br>
    equity ratio = total equity / total assets<br>
    equity ratio = $37,000 / $94,000<br>
    equity ratio = 0.39<br>
    Why use equity ratio?<br>
    the equity ratio is used because it tells how much of the company's assets are funded by issuing stock and not by borrowing. It is also an indicator of a firm's financial stability in the long run.<br>
